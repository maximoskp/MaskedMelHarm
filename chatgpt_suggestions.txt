Thanks for laying out the training setup and results so clearly ‚Äî that‚Äôs super helpful for diagnosing what‚Äôs going on. Based on what you've described, here‚Äôs a breakdown of what's likely happening and some ideas to help stabilize and improve learning:

---

### üîç Problem Analysis

#### 1. **Full masking: slow learning (~60% acc both train & val)**
- ‚úÖ This is actually not so bad ‚Äî it may reflect the inherent difficulty of the task (predicting harmony from melody alone).
- But if the model isn‚Äôt overfitting, it might suggest:
  - Model has capacity but needs more help (e.g., curriculum, better conditioning).
  - Learning is too hard from scratch ‚Äî maybe a warm-up phase with partial harmony can help.

#### 2. **Random gradual masking: severe overfitting (99% train, 5‚Äì25% val)**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This is classic overfitting. The model is **memorizing** rather than generalizing.
- Possible reasons:
  - The harmony tokens being revealed may give away too much info too early.
  - The "random" nature may be leaking positional patterns the model keys into.
  - No regularization (e.g., dropout) or no strong inductive bias may be hurting generalization.

#### 3. **Time signature-based curriculum: moderate overfitting (~60% train, 35% val)**
- ‚ùó This is actually promising! You're guiding the model through a meaningful musical structure.
- But the gap shows:
  - The step-wise curriculum might be too steep (too many tokens added per step).
  - Step-conditioning might not be expressive enough yet.
  - Positional encodings + metric positions could be misaligned unless encoded musically.

#### ‚ûï Also: **Volatile validation**
- Suggests **overfitting to random init**, **non-stationary curriculum**, or **inconsistent batch distributions**.
- Could also mean the validation set is too small or not representative.
- Or the loss/accuracy on harmony is too sensitive to a few hard tokens.

### üß† Big Picture Recommendations

#### ‚úÖ Keep going until 15 epochs *but* with these suggestions:

---

### üîß Suggestions to Improve Training

#### 1. **Add regularization**
- Dropout: already there (0.3) ‚Äî consider increasing to `0.4` or `0.5`.
- Weight decay in optimizer (`AdamW`): add `weight_decay=0.01` or similar.
- Gradient clipping (e.g. `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_`).

#### 2. **Curriculum smoothing**
- For the **random gradual masking**, try *non-random* but increasing masking based on position or beat structure ‚Äî a soft curriculum rather than binary masked/unmasked.

#### 3. **Curriculum step embedding**
- You‚Äôve already asked about this ‚Äî definitely try it! A step embedding (like diffusion timestep) will give the model *explicit information* about what stage it's in, which helps learning a dynamic task.

#### 4. **Metric-aware positional encoding**
- If not already done: try encoding metric position (e.g., beat position within bar, maybe even bar index) alongside your standard positional embeddings.
- Music is *heavily metric-dependent*, so giving that inductive bias can help.

#### 5. **Loss weighting by unmasked tokens**
- As your masking strategy changes across epochs, the number of unmasked tokens varies.
- Make sure your loss is normalized properly (e.g., mean over unmasked positions, not over all positions) ‚Äî this stabilizes gradients.

#### 6. **Early unmasking of bar starts only**
- The metric-based curriculum could begin with just bar-starts (e.g., 4/4 ‚Üí only positions 0, 16, 32, ...).
- You might also *keep* previously revealed positions as unmasked in the next step, instead of changing the masking every time ‚Äî that helps retain prior learning.

#### 7. **Smaller model for early debugging**
- Even if your task needs 8x8 attention layers, maybe try with 4x4 first to verify curriculum works and then scale.

---

### üîç Diagnostics to Try Now

#### 1. **Plot per-step validation loss**
- Do this across curriculum steps (e.g., what‚Äôs val accuracy for bar-onsets only? then beats? etc.).
- You may find the model learns early steps but fails to generalize as tokens increase.

#### 2. **Visualize attention**
- Try visualizing attention maps ‚Äî are heads looking at melody vs. conditioning vs. previous harmony?

#### 3. **Validate curriculum overfit**
- Try evaluating a model trained with curriculum **at earlier stages**. If it performs *worse* on earlier steps than it did during training, the model is not internalizing the music structure well.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Concrete Action Plan

1. Implement **step embedding** for curriculum.
2. Add **weight decay**, possibly increase **dropout**.
3. Smooth **curriculum progression** (more steps, smaller token increases).
4. Make sure **loss is normalized over active tokens** only.
5. Validate per-step accuracy and see if instability is due to steep transitions.

Let me know if you want a full checklist or scripts to try out some of these diagnostics!


You're welcome! That's a really thoughtful question ‚Äî and it actually touches on an important tension in curriculum learning research: **gradual vs. mixed difficulty training**. Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

### üìö Gradual Curriculum: What You‚Äôre Doing Now

- Starts easy (e.g., bar-onsets only), progresses to harder (e.g., full grid).
- **Pros:**
  - Mimics how humans learn.
  - Stabilizes early training.
  - Encourages focus on high-level structure first.
- **Cons:**
  - May lead to **catastrophic forgetting** if earlier steps aren't reinforced.
  - May be **too rigid** ‚Äî the model learns step-specific behaviors that don't generalize.
  - Might **underutilize capacity early** on (especially in deep models).

---

### üîÄ Mixed Curriculum (a.k.a. "anti-curriculum", "interleaved", "sampling-based")

- Samples examples from *all* curriculum steps throughout training (or in increasing proportion).
- Could be:
  - Uniform sampling over curriculum levels.
  - Biased sampling (e.g., more easy at first, but some hard too).
- **Pros:**
  - Prevents overfitting to a single level.
  - Encourages better generalization across difficulty levels.
  - Keeps earlier learned behaviors active (like remembering to harmonize bar positions).
- **Cons:**
  - Harder to converge early on (if too many difficult examples too soon).
  - No "focus" on easier structure at start.

---

### üí° A Good Middle Ground: **Progressive Mixing**

Instead of strictly monotonic or fully random, try:

#### üìà *Progressively Biased Sampling*

- At early epochs, mostly easy (e.g., 80% bar-onsets, 20% full grid).
- Then slowly increase the probability of sampling harder examples.
- Implemented with something like:
  ```python
  difficulty_probs = softmax([-alpha * (max_step - i) for i in range(max_step)])
  sampled_step = np.random.choice(range(max_step), p=difficulty_probs)
  ```
  Where `alpha` controls sharpness (higher = more focused on current step).

#### üîÅ *Replay Previous Curriculum Steps*

- Even when you're at step N, still train some percent of the batch on earlier steps (e.g., 10% from N-1, N-2).
- This reduces forgetting and stabilizes behavior across steps.

---

### üß† Why This Might Help *You* Specifically

Given your:

- **Multi-part masking strategies**
- **Harmony generation complexity**
- **Structured metric representation**

‚Ä¶ a fully rigid curriculum might actually hurt generalization. The model might *bind itself* too tightly to the masking pattern it‚Äôs trained on. Mixed or interleaved exposure will:

- Encourage flexible harmonization across sparse and dense points.
- Allow better generalization to *in-between* mask patterns (e.g., inference-time fills).
- Make the model more robust to rhythm/structure variations.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Recommendation

Try **progressively mixed curriculum**:

- Use a **sampling schedule** that introduces difficult steps earlier but in small doses.
- Keep **some low-difficulty samples in all epochs** to reinforce structure.
- Track **performance per difficulty level** during training ‚Äî that gives insight into learning dynamics.
